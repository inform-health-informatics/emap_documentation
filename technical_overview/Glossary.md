## A

- ATOS

	Hospital IT Contractor

- Audit classes

	Code used to keep track of hospital data that been corrected/deleted to allow for a complete trail of changes in an item of data to be preserved.
## B

## F

## G

- getter

	Term used to refer to computer code used to retrieve types of data e.g. a function getName() would be used to retrieve the 'name' piece of data. Opposite of setter. 

## H

- HL7 Health Level 7

	A standard for exchanging information between medical applications.

## I

- IDS Immutable Data Store

	This is the database that receives all live HL7 messages being sent by the Epic system. This database is never changed or deleted, and thus holds a record of all live HL7 messages sent since the point at which Epic was turned on.
- Indexing

	A database index allows a query to efficiently retrieve data from a database.  Indexes are related to specific tables and consist of one or more keys.

- RabbitMQ

- Relationships (database)

## S

- setter

	Term used to refer to computer code used to set the value of data e.g. a function setName('my name') would be used to set the 'name' piece of data to the value 'my name'. Opposite of getter.

- Sharding

- SIP Strategic Integration Platform
	
	The SIP acts as a central controller for all electronic messaged being sent within the hospital. It routes messages from various sources (POC, HSL, Imaging) to be recorded in the appropriate databases. 
- Star

	The EMAP database that contains the processed data and can be queried by users.
