## Repository Practices

Each repo had branches main and develop which are both locked.

Development happens on a feature branch.
In order to merge to develop the branch must pass both linting and unit tests and have at least one approving review.

When a release is done, versin numbers are changed and mrged to devlop which is than merged to main.
