## Data Dictionary

We have started to create a data dictionary with details of the star database. Preliminary version is available [here](../data_dictionary/star_data.md).

## Tables changed

| Table           | Attributes added | Attributes removed |
| :-              |:-                |:-                  |
| ***visit_observation_type***   | ***visit_observation_type_id***       | ***visit_observation_type***         |

| ***visit_observation_type***   | ***description*** |  |
| ***visit_observation_type***   | ***display_name*** |  |
| ***visit_observation_type***   | ***name*** | *** name_in_application*** |

### Explanation

***visit_observation_type.visit_observation_type*** was renamed to ***visit_observation_type_id*** to maintain consistency in primary key names

***visit_observation_type.source_application*** was renamed to ***source_observation_type*** to be more explicit that it is storing the type of observation (e.g. `flowsheet`)

*** visit_observation_type.name_in_application *** was renamed to ***name***
